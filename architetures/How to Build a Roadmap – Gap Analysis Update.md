 have received a number of requests about the tools and methods used to complete the gap analysis steps from earlier posts in the series How to Build a Roadmap. In this series I have discussed the specific steps required to develop a well thought out road map where one of the key tasks was conducting a gap analysis exercise. Understanding the limits of a medium like this I have posted this update to explore the questions in a little more detail. Believe this will be extremely useful to anyone building a meaningful road map. The internet is full of simply awful templates and tools which range from the downright silly to extremely dangerous in their simple assumptions where there is no attempt to quantify results. Even more distressing is lack of understanding of how to use and leverage the best data sources you already have – the professionals within your own organization. Save yourself some time and read on.

Recall the road map development identified specific actions using an overall pattern ALL road maps should follow. The steps required to complete this work:

Develop a clear and unambiguous understanding of the current state
Define the desired end state
Conduct a Gap Analysis exercise
Prioritize the findings from the Gap Analysis exercise into a series of gap closure strategies
Discover the optimum sequence of actions (recognizing predecessor – successor relationships)
Develop and Publish the Road Map
