Space Based Architecture

Space-based architecture (SBA) is a software architecture pattern for achieving linear scalability of stateful, high-performance applications using the tuple space paradigm. It follows many of the principles of representational state transfer (REST), service-oriented architecture (SOA), and event-driven architecture (EDA), as well as elements of grid computing. With a SBA, applications are built out of a set of self-sufficient units, known as processing-units (PU) or elastic processing-units (EPU). These units are independent of each other, so the application can scale by adding more units (called also “instances”).
