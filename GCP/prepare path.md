Notes and main points:

# Networking
It is the most important topic and includes everything about Google Cloud Networking. A word of caution, regular practice is needed to get a hang of all the theoretical concepts like This topic is a must. You must be able to write GCloud commands for IAM Roles.
- Shared VPC and VPC peering
- Subnets
- Cloud Router
- Firewall Rules
- Load Balancing
# Storage
 You must have a clear understanding of different storage options available in Google Cloud and when to use them. Check this link for more information.

# Compute
This includes App Engine, Compute Engine, and Kubernetes. You need to learn deployment, versioning, and rollback in App Engine. In Kubernetes, you must learn docker files — how to build docker files, different type of docker file and what are the different components of Kubernetes cluster (pod, node, services, load balancing, exposing services to the outside world). You must have a clear understanding of the different components of this construct’s yaml file.

# Deployment  
You must gain a good understanding of different pieces of deployment .yaml file. From this section, you can expect some good question related to Deployment manager.

# Monitoring

You should be aware of Stackdriver stack i.e. monitoring, logging, tracing, debugging, profiling. Filtering, logging, and generating monitoring alerts are must-to-know topics.

# Security
This includes working with IAM Roles, Firewall settings, and others. There are some roles or permission which are specific. You must have a clear understanding of the different roles that IAM provides.




- Comany X has deployed an application using App Engine. They want to release a new version of that application to production. They want to test that application on only a set of users. What is the most appropriate solution?

https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/splitting-traffic

When you have specified two or more versions for splitting, you must choose whether to split traffic by using either an IP address or HTTP cookie. It's easier to set up an IP address split, but a cookie split is more precise.
