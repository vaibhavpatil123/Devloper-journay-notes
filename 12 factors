To summarize briefly, a twelve-factor app should be designed and maintained in these ways:

Stored in a single codebase, tracked in a version control system: one codebase, many deployments
Has explicitly declared and isolated external dependencies
Has deployment-specific configuration stored in environment variables, and not in the code
Treats backing services (for example, data stores, message queues, and so on) as attached or replaceable resources
Built in distinct stages (build, release, run) with strict separation among them (no knock-on effects or cycles)
Runs as one or more stateless processes that share nothing, and assumes process memory is transient
Is completely self-contained and provides a service endpoint on well-defined (environment determined) host and port
Managed and scaled through process instances (horizontal scaling)
Disposable with minimal startup, graceful shutdown, and toleration for abrupt process termination
Designed for continuous development and deployment with minimal difference between the app in development and the app in production
Treats logs as event streams: the outer or hosting environment deals with processing and routing log files
Keeps one-off admin scripts with the app to ensure the admin scripts run with the same environment as the app itself
