Repeat these points every morning as a mantra:

The goals you set or your rank on your pomodoro application don’t matter. What matter is you trying to accomplish your goals. Don’t stop trying.
If you don’t achieve everything you want this time, that’s okay. You will do better next time. Failing is not a bad outcome but a possibility to grow.
Don’t set any hard deadlines and don’t beat yourself up to finish a task.
The most difficult is to begin a task. Just force yourself to work 10 minutes and see if you want to continue. If not, stop working. It’s that simple.
Time constraints can give boundaries: decide to work on a side project for a limited amount of time per week and stick to it. No more, maybe less. At least most of the time.
What’s important is working on a consistent basis. Doing a little bit every week for one year is better than beating yourself up for three weeks and giving up, exhausted.
