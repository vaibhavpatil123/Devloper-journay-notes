"Software architecture is a participation sport. While you can learn a great deal about practices, patterns, coupling, cohesion, and all the other facets of software architecture, you don’t really understand them until you put them in practice. "

“The real problem is that programmers have spent far too much time worrying about efficiency in the wrong places and at the wrong times; premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.”

Recognize that you are on a plateau
This is an important step that will help you build a strategy for future behavior.
Take a break
Take a break from learning. Sometimes you should pause to analyze what you have already learned, what you are doing best, and what areas that need your attention. 
Remember to think about your goals
Why do you need this skill? Perhaps the goal should be reformulated or adjusted. Remember that overcoming difficulties today leads to something important tomorrow.
Plan your next step
This will help you see the result faster and bring you closer to achieving your main goal.
Try new learning techniques
Change the format: for example, individual training instead of group training. And sometimes, it is enough to try to learn in a new environment, for instance, in a park or on your balcony.
Interact with other people
Talk to people who are learning the same skill. This will not only help you get support but also expand your knowledge.
Practice as often as possible
Nothing motivates us better than concrete results and small victories. So do not give up, practice, and run-through what you have learned until you feel confident.
