Download and Extract Apache Kafka from here.
At the time of writing the current stable version is 0.10.1.1.
Prerequisite
Install JRE.
Install and Configure Apache Zookeeper.
Setting up Apache Kafka
Go to config folder in Apache Kafka and edit “server.properties” using any text editor.
Find log.dirs and repelace after “=/tmp/kafka-logs” to “=C:\\Tools\\kafka_2.10–0.10.1.1\\kafka-logs” (change your version number).
Leave other setting as is. If your Apache Zookeeper on different server then change the “zookeeper.connect” property.
By default Apache Kafka will run on port 9092 and Apache Zookeeper will run on port 2181.
Running Apache Kafka
Open command prompt and go to your Apache Kafka directory and run following command.
.\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

Apache Kafka running on Command Prompt
You are good to go, your Apache Kafka is up and running on port 9092.
Creating Topics, Consumer and Producer in Apache Kafka
Creating Topic
Open command prompt and go to Apache Kafka installation directory.
Go to \bin\windows directory.
Run the following command.
kafka-topics.bat — create — zookeeper localhost:2181 — replication-factor 1 — partitions 1 — topic sql-insert
You will see the output.

Created topic “sql-insert”.
Creating Consumer & Producer
Open a command prompt and go to Apache Kafka installation directory.
Go to \bin\windows directory.
Run the following command to start a producer.
kafka-console-producer.bat — broker-list localhost:9092 — topic sql-insert
The broker-list parameter specifies the brokers to be connected as <node_address:port> — that is, localhost:9092.
Again Open a command prompt and go to Apache Kafka installation directory.
Go to \bin\windows directory.
Run the following command to start a consumer.
kafka-console-consumer.bat -bootstrap-server localhost:2181 -topic sql-insert

Producer & Consumer running on Command Prompt
By running all four components (zookeeper, broker, producer, and consumer) in different terminals, you will be able to enter messages from the producer’s terminal and see them appearing in the subscribed consumer’s terminal. If everything works fine, you will be able to push and see messages.
Congratulation! Your Apache Kafka setup is complete.
