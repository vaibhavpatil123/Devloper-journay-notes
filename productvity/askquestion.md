How to Ask the Right Questions?	 
When we come across issues in our life at work, and beyond, we often employ various techniques to solve them and find resolutions. 
One of the easiest and quickest ways to find the right solution is to ask the right questions.  	 
 
 
Asking the right questions leads to the right solutions quicker. Here is a list of questions that we can ask ourselves when we are in the midst of a problem to arrive at a solution efficiently.	 
 
How can I describe the problem in one sentence?
This question helps you focus on the most critical aspects. Sometimes it helps you realize that there is no problem or, on the contrary, there are several problems.	 
 
From what I know about the problem, what are the facts, and what are my judgments?
The answer to this question reveals the actual level of awareness. You will be able to understand what facts are missing to find balanced solutions.	 
 
Why did this problem occur?
Identifying root causes helps to act pointwise, solve the problem itself, and not remove the symptoms.	
 
What resources can I use for the solution?
It would help if you thought about the team, experts, experience, and time reserve.
For each of these categories, it is better to write down all the options to expand the field of possible solutions.	
 
What solutions are available?
Clarifications work well here. For example,
•	What is the desired result?
•	What is the easiest solution?
•	What are the most proven methods?	
 
What are the risks of each solution?
The answer to this question allows you to evaluate the consequences of different decisions, helping you choose one or more optimal options from the set.	
 
What should I do to prevent the problem from happening again?
When answering, you should think about how to describe the processes and best practices (checklists can help) so that the problem doesn't appear again.
