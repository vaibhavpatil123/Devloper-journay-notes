One of the things I love the most about Kelsey Hightower’s Kubernetes The Hard Way guide— other than it just works (even on AWS!)—is that it keeps networking clean and simple; a perfect opportunity to understand what the role of the Container Network Interface (CNI) is for example. Having said that, Kubernetes networking is not really very intuitive, especially for newcomers… and do not forget “there is no such thing as container networking”
